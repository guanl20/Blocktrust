In recent years, global supply chains have become increasingly complex, necessitating reliable and transparent systems to manage the vast flow of information among stakeholders. (Ziolkowski et al., 2020) Despite rapid advancements in digital technology, traditional supply chain systems face significant challenges, particularly in transparency, efficiency, and security. These systems often operate with limited visibility across various stakeholders—manufacturers, distributors, and retailers—leading to inefficiencies, trust issues, and data discrepancies. Furthermore, issues of ethical sourcing and sustainability have intensified scrutiny on supply chains, making it crucial for companies to prove the legitimacy and ethical standards of their suppliers. To address these challenges, blockchain technology, with its decentralized, immutable nature, has emerged as a promising solution, offering end-to-end visibility, security, and accountability within the supply chain network.

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions across multiple participants. Unlike traditional systems that rely on a central authority, blockchain operates in a decentralized environment, enabling stakeholders to verify transactions independently and maintain a trusted record of all interactions. BlockTrust, the proposed project, leverages blockchain to enhance trust and transparency within supply chains, thus reducing inefficiencies and increasing accountability among stakeholders. By implementing smart contracts, BlockTrust will enable automated role verification and product tracking, ensuring that all stakeholders can access reliable and verified data throughout the supply chain process.

The concept of integrating blockchain into supply chain management has gained traction, with various organizations exploring its potential to address issues like fraud prevention, traceability, and compliance with environmental and ethical standards. However, many current implementations are limited in scope or lack user-friendliness, restricting widespread adoption. BlockTrust aims to fill these gaps by providing an accessible and comprehensive blockchain solution tailored for supply chains, specifically focusing on efficient role management, verification, and real-time product tracking. The project builds on existing blockchain principles while introducing innovations that make it adaptable for large-scale supply chains. This research is designed to demonstrate how BlockTrust can improve transparency, reduce operational friction, and foster trust among stakeholders, ultimately contributing to the advancement of supply chain management technology.

2.1.2 Statement of the Problem

Traditional supply chain systems suffer from inefficiencies, limited visibility, and lack of trust among stakeholders. (Ziolkowski et al., 2020) Although blockchain technology offers solutions to these challenges, current applications in supply chain management are often complex and not widely adopted, primarily due to their limited functionality and usability issues. Prior research has indicated that while blockchain can enhance transparency and security, there is a need for tailored systems that can handle specific roles and responsibilities within a supply chain, such as role verification, product tracking, and stage-based information updates. 

BlockTrust seeks to address these gaps by introducing a blockchain-based platform designed specifically for supply chains. Unlike existing solutions, BlockTrust provides a user-friendly interface and a robust system for role verification through smart contracts. These smart contracts store essential data points, allowing stakeholders to track the product journey from manufacturing to retail seamlessly. By enabling real-time updates and role-based access, BlockTrust ensures transparency at every stage, ultimately improving efficiency and trust among all participants. This project aims to contribute a functional, accessible blockchain system that resolves the unaddressed problem of operational transparency within complex supply chains.

2.2 CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW.
2.2.1 Introduction

Blockchain technology is recognized for its potential to solve long-standing issues in supply chain management, such as lack of transparency, inefficiency, and mistrust among stakeholders. Blockchain's decentralized and immutable nature enhances data security and accessibility, establishing it as a solution for transparent, verifiable supply chain processes (Mearian, 2018). The literature review discusses blockchain’s applications within supply chains, exploring its benefits, challenges, and implementation examples to set the groundwork for BlockTrust’s contribution to this field.
2.2.2 Blockchain in Supply Chains: Benefits and Challenges
Blockchain’s integration in supply chains offers key benefits, including:
1. Transparency and Traceability: Blockchain creates a shared ledger, allowing real-time tracking of goods, as evidenced by IBM’s Food Trust, which enables companies like Walmart to track food from source to sale, enhancing safety (Kamath, 2018)ii14.
2. Efficiency and Automation: Blockchain enables automation via smart contracts, reducing paperwork and processing times (Buterin, 2014), essential for streamlining processes such as customs clearance.iii14
3. Enhanced Security: Blockchain’s immutable records safeguard data from tampering, critical in industries like supplychain, where counterfeit prevention is essential .iii14
4. Cost Reduction: Studies suggest blockchain reduces long-term costs by minimizing intermediaries and improving operational efficiencies, achieving up to 20% cost savings (Kshetri, 2018).v

Despite these advantages, several challenges limit blockchain adoption:
